		<h2>Deep Dive 1</h2>
		<h1>Sub-aerial Beach Inventory of Puerto Rico</h1>
						
		
				
		<p> Sub-aerial beaches are defined as deposits of unconsolidated sediments, including sand or gravel, extending from permanent physiographic features <br>
		landward (vegetation, dunes and/or man-made structures)	to the high water level. This map presents a sub-aerial beach inventory <br>
		I created during my undergraduate studies at the University of Puerto Rico, using ArcGIS 10.1 through interpretation of high-resulotuion imagery collected in 2010. <br>
		Characteristics such as beach area, length, presence of beachrock and other barriers, river mouths, and adjacent structures were added to the attribute table. <br>
		A total of 1,225 sub-aerial beaches were identified in Puerto Rico mainland, Vieques and Culebra island-municipalities, <br>
		and Caja de Muertos Island. This beach inventory represents the first detailed geographic database of beaches in Puerto Rico, which can be updated and <br>
		could serve to monitor morphological changes and data relevant to coastal studies.
		</p>
		
		<p> <b> Zoom in </b> to any of the arrow markers of beast beaches and you will see golden-colored polygons representing the boundaries of sub-aerial beaches. <br>
		These can be found throughout the coast of Puerto Rico and municipality-islands. <b> Click the markers and polygons </b> to find out more about each of them.
		</p>
		
		<p id="notice"> <b> InfoWindows error </b> <br> </p>
		<p>The info windows are not displaying the information as I set them up to. <br>
		In the mean time, you can see how they should look <a href="https://goo.gl/HGmIwx">here</a>.
		</p>
		
		<div id="map_canvas"></div>		
				
		<p> <b> Note that </b> the digitization of beach structures was based on the interpretation of imagery that is not the one displayed in this map. <br>
		Thus, the beach polygons may not match exactly the basemaps provided in the map, and may appear to be misplaced. That said, you will be able <br>
		to have a glimpse of how dynamic the erosion and deposition of sediments can be. You will see that in most places the landward boundary matches <br>
		the vegetation/man-made structure lines, but not the high-water line. This is because sand has been removed or added through natural processes. <br>
		This change occurs constantly throughout the year, but some beaches <i>are</i> suffering erosion without recovery, <br>
		especially in areas with adjacent human develompent.
		</p>
		
		<p> I chose to display this shapefile for our Deep Dive 1 to learn how to integrate spatial data using Google Fusion Tables <br>
		on Google API maps. In this map I used a hybrid basemap, so that the audience can visualize the beach systems through the satellite image, <br>
		and also be able to see the road network and places of interest near them. This map also includes the markers created for <a href="map_m4.html">Milestone 4</a>, <br>
		as well as a few additional beach locations, to show some of the best beaches in the Island vis a vis beach boundaries from the inventory.
