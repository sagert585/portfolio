    <p id="spar"><span style="float: left; font-size: 200%; line-height: 80%; text-shadow: 1px 1px #FFFFFF;">SPAR| </span>SPAR is a SPatial Access Ratio &#8211 a score assigned to an area that reflects how easily the residents of that area can access a resource. In this case, the resource is mammography facilities and residents are being counted at the census block group level (smaller than a county, and smaller than a census tract). Posted speed limits were used to calculate travel time from the population-weighted-centroid of each group to all facilities, and from each facility to all population-weighted-centroids. These travel times were used to calculate access scores, and each access score was normalized by the average of all scores to determine the SPAR of each group. This is an example of the Enhanced Two-Step Floating Catchment Area Method (E2SFCAM) of analyzing supply and demand.<br>
      &#8198 &#8198 The scores range from TALK ABOUT SCORES HERE.</p>
    <p id="incidence"><span style="float: left; font-size: 200%; line-height: 80%; text-shadow: 1px 1px #FFFFFF;">INCIDENCE| </span>This map shows breast cancer incidence as a per capita rate in each small health area. Small health areas are units of aggregation (generally larger than a census tract but smaller than a county) used by the New Mexico Department of Health for releasing health information to the public while protecting patient confidentiality. Records from 2011-2013 were used, and include both in-situ and invasive cancer, all cancer stages, men and women, all races, and all ages.<br>
      &#8198 &#8198 The incidence rates range from TALK ABOUT SCORES.</p>
    <p id="area"><span style="float: left; font-size: 200%; line-height: 80%; text-shadow: 1px 1px #FFFFFF;">STUDY AREA| </span>The area of interest for this research was limited to the Albuquerque metro area, represented in this case by the city limits (as black lines) of Albuquerque and Rio Rancho. Future research on this topic should consider differences in access between urban and rural populations, and expand to include all facilities and population centers in the state.</p>
    <p id="facilities"><span style="float: left; font-size: 200%; line-height: 80%; text-shadow: 1px 1px #FFFFFF;">FACILITIES| </span>The main facilities of interest &#8211 those offering mammograms &#8211 are symbolized by blue crosses. These facilties are CERTIFIED IN SOME FASHION by the USFDA. Red crosses show other hospitals in the area, but exclude specialty hospitals, urgent care facilities, and nursing homes. Mammography facilities are the focus because of the importance of preventive care and cancer screening in increasing cancer survivorship and reducing cancer mortality.</p>
