      <p id="sub">The Apostle Islands National Lakeshore<br>
        With a Custom Map Style</p>
      <p align = "center"><a href="index.html">Home</a></p>
      <p>While I changed so many things with the style wizard that I don't remember them all (I guess I should have kept track), this map style was designed to emphasize some of my favorite memories of the Apostle Island National Lakeshore. Built upon the default style with some inspiration from the Retro style, changing the water features to deep blue and the parks to bold green highlights the lake and the islands. Man-made features were given a periwinkle that mixes concrete grey, a hint of the page's lilac background, and cool blue, as the lakeshore towns are culturally and financially driven by what happens on the water. At finer scales, a heavier weight on transportation lines makes the Madeline Island Ferry route stand out, and the small airport on Madeline Island takes on a pale burgundy. When the Terrain setting is toggled off, the Red Cliff Reservation becomes more evident.</p>
