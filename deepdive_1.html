	<p id="story" align = "center"><a href="http://www.bigtop.org/" target="_blank">Big Top Chautauqua</a> is a summer tradition near Wisconsin's South Shore of Lake Superior &#8212; an arts and entertainment celebration of local culture housed under a big tent. "Riding the Wind" was the first show at the Big Top and is an enduring favorite, offering a musical tour through local history, from indigenous legend of the Islands formation to the sawmill days to the lives of the lighthouse keepers. The lattermost is featured in "Keeper of the Light," a song that island hops to every lighthouse in the Islands.<p>
	    <p style='text-indent: 40px'>I visited or saw many of these lighthouses on family vacations in my childhood, while reading books about the shipwrecks and wearing out my cassette of "Keeper of the Light" on my walkman. The points on the above map help illustrate the history and culture of a beautiful corner of the U.S., and a place of which I have many fond memories.</p>
